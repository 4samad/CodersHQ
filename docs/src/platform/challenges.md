# Challenges

## Introduction

Challenges should be a process and a tool for private companies to create challenges and post them to CHQ (Coders Headquarters) so that users would be able to enter and potentially win a reward.

## Requirements

### Level 1 Requirements
These are the requirements that must be met when creating the challenge section.

+ Companies should be able to create challenges
+ Challenges should be viewed publicly in the website 
+ Participants should be able to choose a challenge, or multiple challenges, and participate in them
+ Participants should be able to send their solution to the challenges
+ Companies should be able to view participantsâ€™ challenge entries
+ Companies should be able to communicate with participants
+ Companies should be able to send participants custom messages
+ Companies should be able to select challenge winners

### Level 2 Requirements
These requirements are softer requirements yet require a very good reason not to meet any one of these.

Questions: 
These are yet unanswered questions. When answered these should be striked through and pushed into the relevant section.

+ Should we save the interaction between users and companies?
+ How many attempts should we give users?
+ How often should we allow users?
+ Should we give score to winners only?
+ How should we score winners?
