# User System

This encompasses everything related to the user in terms of account creation, signing in and logiggn out. All the user data should be displayed in a dashboard where other users/entities can view their basic information.

As a milestone, we would like to also add the aspect of social sign in through (Google, Linkedin and Github accounts) â€“ Additional to that we would like to pull some of the open information and display it on the individual dashboard.
