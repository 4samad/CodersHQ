# Scoring

Coders HQ main tool would be the ranking system. This will rank coders in the website in terms of their activities and achievements in and out of CHQ. This is a highly anticipated tool.

It is recommended that the scoring mechanism includes the following : (Pluralsight ranking, Codechef ranking, Hacker rank ranking) : it will be awesome, if we can pull information from these websites to build a more contextual ranking system.

It will be awesome also to find a mechanism to add all certificated gained from educational websites + coders HQ and transform them to points + make the certificates visual. This can be done through the following: 

1. Create 3 different categories, and assign a number of points for every category, for example category 1 : Short seminars from CHQ, Category 2 : Nano-degrees (Coursera + Udemy + edx) + corporations degrees (Microsoft + Oracle + AWS etc.), Category 3  longer degrees (6-18+ months types of degrees) 
2. Create a mechanism where individuals can submit their certificates, and assign a number of points for every certificate.
3. Each point in the coders HQ is equal to 1 Peacock coin/token
